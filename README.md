An end-to-end data pipeline project to process IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Azure services. This project demonstrates how raw CSVs are transformed, analyzed, and stored efficiently across the Azure ecosystem.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This pipeline performs:
- Data Ingestion: Uploading IPL CSV files to Azure Blob Storage
- Data Transformation: Processing using PySpark in Azure Databricks
- Graph Generation: Creating visual insights using Matplotlib
- Data Storage: Saving transformed data and graph metadata into Azure Cosmos DB
